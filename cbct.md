## Overall
1. The CBCT is an 8x8cm volume that is well aligned with minimal motion artifacts
2. The CBCT is an 8x8cm volume that has some motion artifacts but is still clinically acceptable
3. The CBCT is an 8x8cm volume that has some alignment issues due to positioning problems with the patient

## Sinuses
1. The maxillary sinuses are clear of any gross radiologic pathology
2. The left/right/bilateral maxillary sinus shows well defined ovoid opacity isodense with soft tissue consistent with a mucous retention cyst - tx not recommended
3. The left/right/bilateral maxillary sinus shows thickened and opacified lining with/without calcifications consistent consistent with chronic sinusitis
4. The left/right maxillary sinus shows a dome shaped opacity isodense with hard tissue consistent with graft material
5. The left/right/bilateral maxillary sinus shows thickened and opacified lining consistent with sinusitis of odontogenic origin from tooth # _____.

## Maxilla/Mandible
1. The maxilla/mandible shows normal radiographic form in shape and symmetry with no gross pathology noted
2. The maxilla/mandible shows radiographic evidence of bony breakdown consistent with possible (osteomyelitis, osteonecrosis, osteoradionecrosis, or malignancy) Clinical correlation with possible biopsy is recommended.
3. The maxilla/mandible shows radiographic evidence of a bony cyst/tumor. The location is , the size is , and has a regular/irregular border, unilocular, multilocular, shows cortical expansion/destruction, and is impinging on adjacent structures. Clinical correlation and biopsy is recommended.
4. Bilateral mandibular tori are present
5. Palatal torus is present
### Notes
- Evaluate NP, IAN, all borders are corticated

## Dentition
1. Radiographically, the patient is (fully dentate, partially edentulous, fully edentulous)
2. Radiographically, the dentition is grossly normal with no significant tooth fractures, wear, caries, periodontal bone loss, malposition, or impaction. (add in what is present)
3. Teeth #___, ___ are impacted
4. Teeth #__, ___, ___ are present. All remaining are missing.
5. Teeth # ___, ___, ____ are replaced by implants. Bone levels are good/bad.
6. All teeth are present except teeth #___,___,___.
### Notes
- If any teeth are not completely visible in the scan, say "unable to confidently report on tooth # as only ____ of the tooth is visible"
- Identify any missing restorations
- For each tooth, assess:
    1. Coronal status (caries, external resorption)
    2. Root canal status (# canals filled, quality of filling (be objective - "5mm short of apex" instead of "poor filling", sealer puff)
    3. Bone loss
    4. Any other pathology
